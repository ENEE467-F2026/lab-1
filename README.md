# ENEE 467 Fall 2026: Robotics Project Laboratory
## Lab 1: Spatial Math and Rigid Body Transformations

This repository contains a Docker container for the first lab as well as the necessary code templates for completing the exercises.

## Overview

Motivation

To avoid software conflicts and increase portability, all lab software will be packaged as a Docker container. Follow the instructions below to get started.

## Building the Container

First check to see if the image is prebuilt on the lab computer by running the following command
```
docker image ls
```
If you see the image named `lab-1-image` in the list then you can skip the build process.

To build the Docker container, ensure that you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) installed and the Docker daemon running.
* Clone this repository and navigate to the `docker` folder
    ```
    cd ~/Labs
    git clone https://github.com/ENEE467-F2026/lab-1.git
    cd lab-1/docker
    ```
* Build the image with Docker compose
    ```
    userid=$(id -u) groupid=$(id -g) docker compose -f lab-1-compose.yml build
    ```

## Starting the Container

The lab computers contain a prebuild image so you will not have to build the image.
* Clone this repo to get the lab-1 code if you haven't done so already
    ```
    cd ~/Labs
    git clone https://github.com/ENEE467-F2026/lab-1.git
    cd lab-1/docker
    ```
* Run the Docker container
    ```
    docker compose -f lab-1-compose.yml run --rm lab-1-docker
    ```
* Once inside the container, you should be greeted with the following prompt indicating that the container is running
    ```
    (lab-1) robot@docker-desktop:~$
    ```

## Lab Instructions

Please follow the [lab manual](Lab_1_Spatial_Math.pdf) closely. All instructions are contained inside the lab manual.
